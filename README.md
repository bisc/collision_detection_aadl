Autonomous Vehicle AADL
========================

This self-driving car model represents the cyber and physical components of a car, and interaction among them.

The main system model is in complete_car_system.aadl. This system consists of six subsystems: 
* Collision prediction
* Collision avoidance
* Collision response
* Networking
* User interaction
* Physical

The original AADL model of (a collision prevention system for use in a telematics architecture) was done in partial fulfillment of the requirements of CPSC 8750 at Clemson University, Spring 2013.
